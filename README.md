# MALWARE-DETECTION-USING-ML
The project, "Malware Detection Using Machine Learning," aims to build a robust system to identify and classify malware using advanced machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to overcome the limitations of traditional signature-based detection methods, which struggle to detect new and evolving threats.
